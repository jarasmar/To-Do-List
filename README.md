# To Do List

I started this project to learn how to build a React.js application from scratch.

### How to run the app
- Clone or download this repository.
- Move to the root folder of the project.
- Open a terminal and run:
`yarn start` or `npm start`
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
